- Insights:
  - Non Loyal cusotmers have a large portion in q3 and q4 (quantity > 10) which means although they've purchased quite a lot but still aren't tagged as Loyal customer => they are potential customers. Therefore, company should send them personalized offers, encourage them to make another purchase soon to increase Recency score and recommend high-value products to increase Monetary score.
    
#### 3. Find indicator in R, F, and M should be most interested in

- Insights:
  - 'Very Recent' customers spend the most who made a purchase most recently and are spending the highest average amount. This is make sense in supermarket settings, the more recently a customer buys, the more they tend to spend => Recency is a powerful driver of revenue in retail industry.
